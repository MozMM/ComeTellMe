This is a lil app that lets people interact with (and get rid of) their own words in a playful and cathartic way. 

I built it with React Native while at Grace Hopper Academy. Its in progress! I challenged myself to write in functional components and hooks, and use CSS for animation. I loved getting to create something that really bubbled up from my creative center. It felt great to have enough facility with coding to actualize something in this medium!

Run this on any android device using the Expo SDK. You'll find the needed app, and QR code here:
