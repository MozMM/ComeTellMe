This is a little app that lets people interact with (and get rid of) their own words in a playful and cathartic way. </br></br>

I built it with React Native while at Grace Hopper Academy. Its in progress! I challenged myself to write in functional components and hooks, and use CSS for animation. I loved using my coding skills to actualize something that really bubbled up from my creative center.</br>

You can run the deployed app on any android device using the Expo SDK. You'll find the needed app, and QR code here:</br>
